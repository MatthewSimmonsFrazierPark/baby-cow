  Matthew Simmons is the former chief operating officer of Lockwood Animal Rescue Center (LARC), which he founded to rescue non-domestic canines and engage in animal advocacy efforts. While running LARC, he established Wolves and Warriors, an initiative that hires combat veterans to help with anti-poaching missions meant to protect wolf populations. During the programâ€™s first year of operation, Matthew Simmons and his team protected more than 300 wolves. Outside of his work in California, he also founded the Predator Healing Project in Montana, which focuses on the rescue and rehabilitation of apex predators with the help of trained combat veterans. 


  Matt Simmons serves on the boards of several other animal advocacy groups.. He took part in an important 2018 case that determined the federal protection of wolves living in captivity. His work to preserve wolf populations and other apex predators has been documented in an Animal Planet show called Wolves and Warriors, as well as the award-winning documentary The War in Between. Mr. Simmons has also been honored by the Ventura County Star as Man of the Year. 


  Matthew Simmons has extensive experience with apex predators as a former animal control officer and part of a support team working with bears, primates, big cats, and wolves. A veteran himself, Mr. Simmons fought in both Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield as a decorated petty officer with the United States Navy. His work helps provide a new sense of meaning and purpose to veterans who were formerly homeless and unemployed. With extensive training, these individuals gain the skills they need to have a significant impact on animals whose lives are in danger.
