  Matthew Simmons founded Predator Healing Project, a non-profit animal rescue
  and advocacy organization based in Kalispell, Montana. He also founded and
  served as the chief operating officer of two other major animal advocacy
  organizations in California from 2009 to 2020. In addition to leading missions
  to rescue wolf and wolf dog populations in California, Alaska and across the
  United States, Matthew Simmons orchestrated a significant expansion of the
  facility and created training manuals on wolf care while teaching new
  employees how to handle these animals properly. He has also supervised and
  trained leaders at other rescue sanctuaries, including Apex Protection
  Project, Reversed Rescue, and Wolf Connection.



  The Predator Healing Project program seeks to involve combat veterans in the rescue and care of animals and has provided a sense of purpose and meaning to the men and women participating. In his role with the initiative, Mr. Simmons organizes anti-poaching missions, recruits new veterans, and leverages his extensive grant-writing experience to help with fundraising. In his previous program’s first year of operation, more than 300 animals were saved.



  Animal Planet covered Mr. Simmons’ career in a television show, his work was the subject of a documentary that received a number of media awards, and he most recently appeared on “Saving Joe Exotic,” a documentary about the fate of the animals rescued from the notorious facility in Oklahoma. In addition, he has been named the Ventura County Star’s Man of the Year. He remains actively involved in several animal rights organizations, including as a board member of several other animal welfare non-profit organizations.



  He is himself a veteran who participated in both Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield. He retired from the US Navy as a decorated petty officer.
